1.0dev (unreleased)
-------------------

- Views like search could fool the request/marker mechanism
  because they somehow don't traverse the nav root.
  So, check to make sure that something odd like this
  hasn't happened by comparing the path from the
  request-based nav root. If they differ, use the old
  mechanism.

- Initial release
